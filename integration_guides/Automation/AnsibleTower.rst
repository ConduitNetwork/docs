Ansible Tower
-------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

|conduit| supports Ansible Tower for configuration management.  |conduit| accomplishes this by integrating with an existing instance running Ansible Tower (AT) 3.3.0-1 and earlier. The username and password required for integration can be a user with admin access or a user with project admin access.
|conduit| will import the current Inventory, Templates, Hosts, Groups and Projects. In the integration view it will add a Job tab which will have information of all the jobs executed from Conduit.
Note: It will not import data of the jobs which are not executed from Conduit.

Provisioning Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When provisioning Instances into a Cloud or Group with a Ansible Tower Integration added, an `Ansible Tower` section will appear in the Config section of the provisioning wizard. By default, Ansible Tower is enabled, but can be disabled by expanding the `Ansible Tower` section and unchecking `Enable Ansible Tower`.

Use Case
^^^^^^^^

You have Job template(s) in Ansible Tower to do post build config after the OS is deployed. The playbook with roles and tasks to do post build will add specific users and groups, install required packages, remove packages, disable services, change config for ntp, resolv, hosts etc. You want to add the instance to an existing Group/Inventory in Tower.

You can achieve this by adding the Ansible Tower Integration and then scope it to a Cloud or Group. While provisioning an instance, in the config stage you have the Ansible Tower section with option to select the post build job template, select the Inventory and provide an existing Group Name or if the Group doesn't exist Conduit will create it and submit for provisioning. 

Conduit will provision the instance, once it is in the finalize state where the instance has an ip and has completed domain join if required, added user(s) or User Groups if specified then Conduit will add the instance to the inventory and Group and run the Template which will do all the post build of the server. 

The output of the post build template execution can be see under Instance history.
