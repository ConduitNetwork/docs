Dell ECS

Overview
^^^^^^^^

|conduit| integrates with DELL EMC ECS via the ECS api. This allows Conduit to talk directly to the ECS services.

When you add a ECS Server, |conduit| will sync in the following.

- File shares

Users will be able to create the following times within ECS without direct access to the ECS console.
