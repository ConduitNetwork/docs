Overview
^^^^^^^^

There are many Task Types available, including scripts added directly, scripts and templates from the Library section, recipes, playbooks, salt states, puppet agent installs, and http (api) calls. Tasks are primarily created for use in Workflows, but a single Task can be executed on an existing instance via ``Actions -> Run Task``.

Role Permissions
````````````````

The User Role Permission 'Provisioning: Tasks  FULL' is required to create, edit and delete tasks.

Tasks Types that can execute locally against the |conduit| Appliance have an additional Role Permission: ``Tasks - Script Engines``. Script Engine Task Types will be hidden for users without ``Tasks - Script Engines`` role permissions.
