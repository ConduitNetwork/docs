v3.2.0
======

.. IMPORTANT:: Conduit v3.2.0+ introduces Global Search, which requires an Elasticsearch upgrade. Upgrading from previous versions of Conduit to a 3.2.0 or later requires you to upgrade ElasticSerach to 5.4.1 or 5.x. We do not support ElasticSearch 6.x at this time.  This upgrade requires you to export and import your Conduit ElasticSearch data if you want to retain logs, backup history, statistics, and check history of your instances. If you do not need to retain that data you can skip the ElasticSearch migration.  Upgrading to 3.2.0+ will create a blank ElasticSearch node with no data. Your Conduit layout configuration will determine how to migrate your ElasticSearch data: all-in-one, distributed high availability, or Conduit clustered appliances.

Please refer to upgrade instructions below the release notes.
