conduit-ctl tips
=====================

``conduit-ctl`` is useful beyond reconfigures and starting the ui, and many commands can be run across all services, or scoped to a singe service.

Some common commands include:

conduit-ctl status
  This list all the installed services and their current Status
conduit-ctl start (service)
  This starts all services if no service is specified, or starts the specified service. For example,

  - ``conduit-ctl start/stop/restart/kill`` on an all-in-one appliance will start, stop, restart or kill mysql, elasticsearch, rabbitmq, check-server, redis, guacd and the conduit-ui, one by one.
  - ``conduit-ctl start/stop/restart/kill conduit-ui`` will only start, stop, restart or kill the conduit-ui service, leaving the other service in their current state.  Same goes for ``conduit-ctl start/stop/restart/kill mysql``, ``conduit-ctl start/stop/restart/kill elasticsearch`` etc.
