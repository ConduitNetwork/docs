v3.6.1
=======

Release date: 2/21/2019

New Features
------------

- Ansible: `Built-in Cypher lookup plugin`_ added. ``"{{lookup('cypher','secret=secret/name')}}"`` can now be used for Cypher Secrets in Ansible playbooks natively.
- Ansible: Refresh info log added conduit-ui current log
- Ansible: |conduit| Agent Command Bus mode speed enhancements
- API/CLI: ``createdBy`` filter added for Instances, Apps and Hosts
- API/CLI: Cypher: New Cypher ``/api/cypher/v1`` endpoint matches Vault endpoints, allowing Vault Clients to use Cypher secrets. The existing ``/api/- cypher`` endpoints remain. CLI ``cypher`` command updated for ``/api/cypher/v1`` endpoints.
- API/CLI: Instances: Improvements to DELETE for Instances and Apps. If an Instance or App delete is called and the instance status is still ``Provisioning``, ``resizing``, ``restarting`` or ``cloning`` the delete is not attempted and an error message is returned, unless ``force=true``
- AWS: ``Costing`` setting added to advanced cloud config options. AWS Costing sync can now be set to "None", "Costing", or "Costing and Reservations".
- Azure: Summary tab added to Azure Cloud detail pages


Built-in Cypher lookup plugin
-----------------------------

A great feature with using Ansible and Conduit together is the built in support for utilizing some of the services that Conduit exposes for automation. v3.6.1 adds native support for using Cypher secrets in Ansible (please see documentation on :ref:`Cypher` for more details). Cypher allows one to store secret data in a highly encrypted way for future retrieval. Referencing keys stored in cypher in your playbooks is a matter of using a built-in lookup plugin for ansible.

.. code-block:: bash

    - name: Add a user
      win_user:
        name: "myusername"
        password: "{{ lookup('cypher','secret=password/myusername') }}"
        state: present


By using the ``{{ lookup('cypher','secret=password/myusername') }}`` syntax. One can grab the value directly out of the key for use. This lookup plugin also supports a few other fancy shortcuts. In this above example the `password/` mountpoint is capable of autogenerating passwords if they have not previously been defined and storing them within cypher for reference later.

Another capability is accessing properties from within a key in cypher. The value of a key can also be a JSON object which can be referenced for properties within. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   {{ lookup('cypher','secret=secret/myjsonobject:value') }}

This would grab the `value` property off the nested json data stored within the key.

Cypher is very powerful for storing these temporary or permanent secrets that one may need to orchestrate various tasks and workflows within Ansible.
