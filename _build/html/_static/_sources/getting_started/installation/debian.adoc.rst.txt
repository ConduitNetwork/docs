[[debian-install]] === Debian / Ubuntu

To get started installing |conduit| on Ubuntu (14.04 currently) a few
prepratory items should be addressed first.

First make sure the apt repository is up to date by running
``sudo apt-get update``. It might also be advisable to verify that the
assigned hostname of the machine is self resolvable.

IMPORTANT: If the machine is unable to resolve its own hostname
(``nslookup hostname``) some installation commands will be unable to
verify service health during installation and fail.

Next simply download the relevant ``.deb`` package for installation.
This package can be acquired from your account rep or via a free trial
request from https://www.conduitdata.com[morheusdata.com].

TIP: Use the ``wget`` command to directly download the package to your
appliance server. i.e.
``wget https://downloads.goconduit.com/path/to/package.deb``

Next we must install the package onto the machine and configure the
conduit services:

.. code-block:: bash
-------------

sudo dpkg -i conduit-appliance\_x.x.x-1.amd64.deb sudo conduit-ctl
reconfigure ----

Once the installation is complete the web interface will automatically
start up. By default it will be resolvable at
``https://your_machine_name`` and in many cases this may not be
resolvable from your browser. The url can be changed by editing
``/etc/conduit/conduit.rb`` and changing the value of
``appliance_url``. After this has been changed simply run:

.. code-block:: bash
-------------

sudo conduit-ctl reconfigure sudo conduit-ctl stop conduit-ui sudo
conduit-ctl start conduit-ui ----

NOTE: The ``conduit-ui`` can take 2-3 minutes to startup before it
becomes available.

There are additional post install settings that can be viewed in the
Advanced section of the guide.

Once the browser is pointed to the appliance a first time setup wizard
will be presented. Please follow the on screen instructions by creating
the master account. From there you will be presented with the license
settings page where a license can be applied for use (if a license is
required you may request one or purchase one by contacting your sales
representative).

More details on setting up infrastructure can be found throughout this
guide.

TIP: If any issues occur it may be prudent to check the conduit log for
details at ``/var/log/conduit/conduit-ui/current``.
