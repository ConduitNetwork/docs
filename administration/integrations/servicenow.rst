Using Approval Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any Instance provisioned into a Cloud or Group with an Approval Policy enabled will be in a PENDING state until the request in Approved.

Instances pending a ServiceNow approval will show "Waiting for Approval" with the Requested Item number and Request number, ex: ``Waiting for Approval [RITM0010002 - REQ0010002]``.

ServiceNow Approval requests are displayed in ``Operations -> Approvals``.
Instances pending a ServiceNow approval must be Approved in ServiceNow for provisioning to initiate. Approval requests from a ServiceNow Approval Policy cannot be approved in Conduit, only Internal Approvals.

ServiceNow Approval requests are displayed in Conduit under ``Operations -> Approvals``. Pending ServiceNow Approval requests can be cancelled in Conduit by selecting the request and then selecting ``ACTIONS -> Cancel``.

Once a pending ServiceNow Approval request is Approved in ServiceNow, the Instance(s) will begin to provision in Conduit within 5 minutes of being approved in ServiceNow.
