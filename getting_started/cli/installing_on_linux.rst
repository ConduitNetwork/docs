Installing on Linux
---------------------

The |conduit| CLI is a ruby based CLI that provides a lot of functionality out of the box and is rapidly growing in coverage to be able to perform every task that can be performed in the |conduit| UI. It is also a great way to get started in exploring the |conduit| API and understanding some of the data model aspects.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A Prerequisite to running the CLI is to have ruby 2.2.0+ installed (2.3.0 recommended). To install Ruby please follow these instructions:

:ref:`ruby-prerequisite`

Once the ruby runtime is installed simply use rubygems to install the CLI

  .. code-block:: text

      gem install conduit-cli

Once the gem is installed all cli commands can be run on the shell via conduit.
