Splunk
------

Overview
^^^^^^^^^ 

The |conduit| Splunk Integration allows forwarding logs from managed Linux hosts and vm's to a target Splunk listener by changing the rsyslogd config on linux vm's to point to Splunk forwarders. The logs will be forwarded from the clients, not from the |conduit| Appliance.
