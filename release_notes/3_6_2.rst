v3.6.2
=======

Release date: 4/9/2019

.. IMPORTANT:: As of v3.6.2 Ubuntu 14.04 is no longer supported for Docker Hosts OS due to Docker version upgrade to address CVE-2019-5736. Existing Conduit Docker Hosts running on 14.04 will not be able to upgrade to latest Conduit Agent version. All new Conduit Docker hosts using Ubuntu require Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.

Highlights
------------

Amazon: Infrastructure Expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AWS VPCs can now be created and deleted directly from the Infrastructure section with the :guilabel:`+ ADD RESOURCE POOL` button in the RESOURCES tab in AWS Cloud detail pages. AWS Subnets can also be created and deleted from the Infrastructure -> Networks section. In addition, VPC's and subnets created with CloudFormation blueprints will automatically created in Conduit upon CloudFormation App provisioning.

Existing AWS S3 Buckets, ELB's and ALBs now sync for AWS Clouds, and Amazon Security Groups and Rules are now listed in the Network Security Group section. Full Amazon Auto Scale Group support added too, including creation, and management of Scale Groups, as well as adding new or existing Instances to Scale Groups and managing auto scale settings.

Task Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Task Results bring the ability for Tasks in a Workflow to use output from other Tasks via results variables. Result types, include json, key/vale pairs and single results, can be set on script tasks and the results are available using ``<%=results.taskCode%>`` variables. See https://docs.conduitdata.com/en/3.6.2/provisioning/automation/automation.html#task-results for more details.


Azure Costs & Cloud Summary Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Azure Cloud costs now sync nightly, reflecting actual charges from Azure rather than estimates for tracked resources. Azure Cloud detail pages now contain a Summary tab with details about the cloud config, Azure resources statistics, and a Costing section including month to date costs, estimated spend, last months costs, and and a Services Breakdown for costs.

Infoblox Optimizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Infoblox can contain a ton of records, and while |conduit| can sync all of them in, we added a few more options to allow syncing in only what is needed. The Zone Filter, like Network Filter, allows control over which zones/domains are synced using Infoblox API filters, and the new “Inventory Existing” flag in the Infoblox Integration settings allows disabling the sync of host and zone record details.

These new controls as well as additional sync optimizations allow for a reduction in network and cpu overhead when Integrating large enterprise Infoblox environments with |conduit|.

More Ansible Love
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.6.2 adds another performance improvement (up to 40%) for the Conduit Agent Command Bus mode for Ansible Integrations, Ansible Group management for existing and brownfield Instances, live std out for Ansible executions, and additional governance role permission for Ansible Integrations.

Security
^^^^^^^^

3.6.2 contains multiple upgrades to address vulnerabilities and enhance security. To address CVE-2019-5736 Docker has been upgraded to 18.09.3, which results in the removal of support for Docker Hosts running Ubuntu 14.04. All new Conduit Docker hosts require Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04, or CentOS/RHEL 7+. Existing Conduit Docker Hosts running on 14.04 will not be able to upgrade to latest Conduit Agent version.
