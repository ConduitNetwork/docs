== Logging Settings

=== Overview

|conduit| contains a built-in logging solution that aggregates logs from hosts and services. Logs are displayed, searchable, and filterable in the Instance, App, Host and overall Logs sections. Logs can also be forwarded using Syslog Forward rules to any external solution that supports syslogs.

|conduit| also has built in Integrations with 3rd Party solutions. When configured, the |conduit| agent will forward logs to the integrated platforms automatically.

Logging Settings for the build-in Logging, Syslog forwards, and 3rd Party Integrations are configurable in the `Administration -> Logs` section.
