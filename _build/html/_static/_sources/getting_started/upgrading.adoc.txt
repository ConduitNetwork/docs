== Upgrading

|conduit| provides a very simple and convenient upgrade process. In most cases it is simply a matter of installing the new package on top of itself and reconfiguring the services.

IMPORTANT: The conduit-ui must be stopped and started during an upgrade. Failure to do so will result in errors.

=== Debian / Ubuntu

Simply download the latest package or request the latest package from your account service representative.

Then run the install process as follows:

.. code-block:: bash
----
sudo dpkg -i conduit-appliance_x.x.x-1.amd64.deb
sudo conduit-ctl stop conduit-ui
sudo conduit-ctl reconfigure
sudo conduit-ctl start conduit-ui
----

This typically is enough to complete a full upgrade. Databases will automatically be migrated upon restart of the application and service version upgrades will automatically be applied.

=== CentOS / RHEL

Yum based package upgrades are a little different. In this case we want to run a `rpm -U` command as the package manager is slightly different.

.. code-block:: bash
----
sudo sudo rpm -U conduit-appliance-x.x.x-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo conduit-ctl stop conduit-ui
sudo conduit-ctl reconfigure
sudo conduit-ctl start conduit-ui
----

TIP: Sometimes it may be necessary to restart all appliance services on the host. In order to do this simply type `sudo conduit-ctl restart`. This will restart ALL services.
